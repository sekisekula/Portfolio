As a passionate and driven Data Scientist, I specialize in developing data models, dashboards, reports, and performance-driven insights. My expertise in Data Science allows me to leverage advanced analytics on large datasets to uncover patterns and dependencies—skills I’ve honed through hands-on experience. I am adept at presenting complex findings in an intuitive and easily understandable manner, ensuring clear communication with stakeholders.

I am highly motivated to continue learning and advancing my career, with a goal of becoming a Data Science Specialist. Beyond my work in data science, I am also deeply interested in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the broader field of data processing using machine learning algorithms.

Core competencies include: Python, SQL, Excel, PowerBI, Tableau, as well as experience with technologies such as Hadoop and AWS.
